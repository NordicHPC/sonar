# Use the daemon's Kafka output path with SONARTEST_MOCK_KAFKA to force output to stdout and
# metadata to stderr.  Force the input with SONARTEST_MOCK_{SACCT,SCONTROL} and force the daemon to
# quit after one run with a debug setting.
#
# Note that any sending-window is OK here.  If we set it to 1s, say, then the timer will fire and
# re-arm repeatedly because the timer fires before all the data can be sent, and the output will
# reflect this.  But the data should all still be sent.  If we set the window to 10s instead then
# there will typically be many fewer firings, because all the messages will be queued up before the
# first firing (unless sonar randomly picks a short window for the first fire).
