# Config file for manual testing from a workstation (node) against a local kafka broker.
#
# The broker needs to know these topics to which sonar will post data:
#
#   fox.educloud.no.sample
#   fox.educloud.no.sysinfo
#   fox.educloud.no.job
#   fox.educloud.no.cluster
#
# The broker needs to know these topics on which sonar will listen for commands:
#
#   fox.educloud.no.control.node
#
# See instructions in ../doc/HOWTO-KAFKA.md (section "Testing with Apache Kafka") for more
# information about how to run things.
