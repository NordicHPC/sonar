# Config file for testing from a compute node that is under Slurm control against a remote Kafka
# broker.
#
# Below, you almost certainly want to change the "kafka > remote-host" setting to suit your needs,
# as your Kafka broker probably runs elsewhere.  Other options may need adjusting too.  Cadences are
# set very aggressively for testing.
#
# See instructions in ../../../doc/HOWTO-KAFKA (section "Testing with Apache Kafka") for more information
# about how to set up Kafka, what the config options mean, etc.
