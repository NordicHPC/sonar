// ## Introduction
//
// Five types of data are collected:
//
// * job and process sample data
// * node sample data
// * job data
// * node configuration data
// * cluster data
//
// The job and process sample data are collected frequently on every node and comprise information
// about each running job and the resource use of the processes in the job, for all pertinent
// resources (cpu, ram, gpu, gpu ram, power consumption, i/o).
//
// The node sample data are also collected on every node, normally at the same time as the job and
// process sample data, and comprise information about the overall use of resources on the node
// independently of jobs and processes, to the extent these can't be derived from the job and
// process sample data.
//
// The job data are collected on a master node and comprise information about the job that are not
// directly related to moment-to-moment resource usage: start and end times, time in the queue,
// allocation requests, completion status, billable resource use and so on.  (Only applies to
// systems with a job manager / job queue.)
//
// The node configuration data are collected occasionally on every node and comprise information
// about the current configuration of the node.
//
// The cluster data are collected occasionally on a master node and comprise information about the
// cluster that are related to how nodes are grouped into partitions and short-term node status; it
// complements node configuration data.
//
// NOTE: Nodes may be added to clusters simply by submitting data for them.
//
// NOTE: We do not yet collect some interesting cluster configuration data â€“ how nodes, racks,
// islands are connected and by what type of interconnect; the type of attached I/O.  Clusters are
// added to the database through other APIs.
//
// ## Slurm
//
// The motivation for extracting Slurm data is to obtain data about a job that are not apparent
// from process samples, notably data about requested resources and wait time, and to store them in
// such a way that they can be correlated with samples for queries and for as long as we need them.
// Data already obtained by process sampling are not to be gotten from Slurm, including most
// performance data and information about resources that are observably used by the job.
//
// The working hypothesis is that:
//
// - all necessary Slurm data can be extracted from a single node in the cluster, as they only
//   include data that Slurm collects and stores for itself
// - the Slurm data collection can be performed by sampling, ie, by running data collection
//   periodically using externally available Slurm tools, and not by getting callbacks from Slurm
//
// That does not remove performance constraints, as the Slurm system is already busy and does not
// need an extra load from a polling client that runs often.  It does ease performance constraints,
// though, as access to the Slurm data store will not impact compute nodes and places a load only
// on administrative systems.  Even so, we may not assume that sampling can run very often, as the
// data volumes can be quite large.  (`squeue | wc` on fox just now yields 100KB of formatted data.)
//
// In principle, Sonar shall send data about a job at least three times: when the job is created
// and enters the PENDING state, when it enters the RUNNING state, and when it has completed (in
// any of a number of different states).  At each of those steps, it shall send data that are
// available at that time that have not been sent before; this includes data that may have changed
// (for example, the Priority may be sent with a PENDING record but if the priority changes later,
// it should be sent again the next time a data sample is sent).  In practice, there are two main
// complications: Sonar runs as a sampler and may not observe a job in all of those states, and it
// may run in a stateless mode in which it will be unable to know whether it has already sent some
// information about a job and can avoid sending it again.  (There is a discussion to be had about
// other events: priority changes, job suspension, job resize.)
//
// Therefore, the Slurm data that are transmitted must be assumed by the consumer to be both
// partial and potentially redundant.  Data in records with later timestamps generally override
// data from earlier records.
//
// ## Data format overall notes
//
// The output is a tree structure that is constrained enough to be serialized as
// [JSON](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259) and other likely serialization formats (protobuf,
// bson, cbor, a custom format, whatever).  It shall follow the [json:api
// specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-structure).  It generally does not
// incorporate many size optimizations.
//
// It's not a goal to have completely normalized data; redundancies are desirable in some cases to
// make data self-describing.
//
// In a serialization format that allows fields to be omitted, all fields except union fields will
// have default values, which are zero, empty string, false, the empty object, or the empty array.
// A union field must have exactly one member present.
//
// Field values are constrained by data types described below, and sometimes by additional
// constraints described in prose.  Primitive types are as they are in Go: 64-bit integers and
// floating point, and Unicode strings.  Numeric values outside the given ranges, non-Unicode
// string encodings, malformed timestamps, malformed node-ranges or type-incorrect data in any
// field can cause the entire top-level object containing them to be rejected by the back-end.
//
// The word "current" in the semantics of a field denotes an instantaneous reading or a
// short-interval statistical measure; contrast "cumulative", which is since start of process/job
// or since system boot or some other fixed time.
//
// Field names generally do not carry unit information.  The units are included in the field
// descriptions, but if they are not then they should be kilobytes for memory, megahertz for
// clocks, watts for power, and percentage points for relative utilization measures.  (Here,
// Kilobyte (KB) = 2^10, Megabyte (MB) = 2^20, Gigabyte (GB) = 2^30 bytes, SI notwithstanding.)
//
// The top-level object for each output data type is the "...Envelope" object.
//
// Within each envelope, `Data` and `Errors` are exclusive of each other.
//
// Within each data object, no json:api `id` field is needed since the monitoring component is a
// client in spec terms.
//
// The errors field in an envelope is populated only for hard errors that prevent output from being
// produced at all. Soft/recoverable errors are represented in the primary data objects.
//
// MetadataObject and ErrorObject are shared between the various data types, everything else is
// specific to the data type and has a name that clearly indicates that.
//
// Some fields present in the older Sonar data are no longer here, having been deemed redundant or
// obsolete.  Some are here in a different form.  Therefore, while old and new data are broadly
// compatible, there may be some minor problems translating between them.
//
// If a device does not expose a UUID, one will be constructed for it by the monitoring component.
// This UUID will never be confusable with another device but it may change, eg at reboot, creating
// a larger population of devices than there is in actuality.
//
// ## Data format versions
//
// This document describes data format version "0".  Adding fields or removing fields where default
// values indicate missing values in the data format do not change the version number: the version
// number only needs change if semantics of existing fields change in some incompatible way.  We
// intend that the version will "never" change.

//
// NOTE: Resident memory is a complicated figure. What we want is probably the Pss ("Proportional
// Set Size") which is private memory + a share of memory shared with other processes but that is
// often not available. Then we must choose from just private memory (RssAnon) or private memory +
// all resident memory shared with other processes (Rss). The former is problematic because it
// undercounts memory, the latter problematic because summing resident memory of the processes will
// frequently lead to a number that is more than physical memory as shared memory is counted
// several times.
//
// NOTE: Container software may not reveal all the process data we want. Docker, for example,
// provides cpu_util but not cpu_avg or cpu_time, and a memory utilization figure from which
// resident_memory must be back-computed.
//
// NOTE: The fields cpu_time, cpu_avg, and cpu_util are different views on the same
// quantities and are used variously by Sonar and the slurm-monitor dashboard. The Jobanalyzer
// back-end computes its own cpu_util from a time series of cpu_time values and using the
// cpu_avg as the first value in the computed series. The slurm-monitor dashboard in contrast
// uses cpu_util directly, but as it will require some time to perform the sampling it slows down
// the monitoring process (a little) and make it more expensive (a little), and the result is less

// ## Slurm Job ID structure
//
// For an array job, the Job ID has the following structure.  When the job is submitted, the job is
// assigned an ID, call it J.  The task at each array index K then has the structure J_K.  However,
// that is for display purposes.  Underneath, each task is assigned an individual job ID T. My test
// job 1467073 with steps, 1, 3, 5, 7, have IDs that are displayed as 1467073_1, 1467073_3, and so
// on.  Importantly those jobs have underlying "true" IDs 1467074, 1467075, and so on (not
// necessarily densely packed, I expect).
//
// Within the job itself the SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID is 1467073 and the SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID is 1, 3, 5,
// 7, but in addition, the SLURM_JOB_ID is 1467074, 1467075, and so on.
//
// Each of the underlying jobs can themselves have steps.  So there is a record (exposed at least
// by sacct) that is called 1467073_1.extern, for that step.
//
// In the data above, we want the job_id to be the "true" underlying ID, the step to be the "true"
// job's step, and the array properties to additionally be set when it is an array job.  Hence for
// 1467073_1.extern we want job_id=1467074, jobs_step=extern, array_job_id=1467073, and
// array_task_id=1.  Here's how we can get that with sacct:
//
// ```
// |  $ sacct --user ec-larstha -P -o User,JobID,JobIDRaw
// |  User        JobID             JobIDRaw
// |  ec-larstha  1467073_1         1467074
// |              1467073_1.batch   1467074.batch
// |              1467073_1.extern  1467074.extern
// |              1467073_1.0       1467074.0
// |  ec-larstha  1467073_3         1467075
// |              1467073_3.batch   1467075.batch
// |              1467073_3.extern  1467075.extern
// |              1467073_3.0       1467075.0
// ```
//
// For heterogenous ("het") jobs, the situation is somewhat similar to array jobs, here's one with
// two groups:
//
// ```
// |  $ sacct --user ec-larstha -P -o User,JobID,JobIDRaw
// |  User        JobID               JobIDRaw
// |  ec-larstha  1467921+0           1467921
// |              1467921+0.batch     1467921.batch
// |              1467921+0.extern    1467921.extern
// |              1467921+0.0         1467921.0
// |  ec-larstha  1467921+1           1467922
// |              1467921+1.extern    1467922.extern
// |              1467921+1.0         1467922.0
// ```
//
// The second hetjob gets its own raw Job ID 1467922.  (Weirdly, so far as I've seen this ID is not
// properly exposed in the environment variables that the job sees.  Indeed there seems to be no
// way to distinguish from environment variables which hetgroup the job is in.  But this could have
// something to do with how I run the jobs, het jobs are fairly involved.)
//
// For jobs with job steps (multiple srun lines in the batch script but nothing else fancy), we get this:
//
// ```
// |  $ sacct --user ec-larstha -P -o User,JobID,JobIDRaw
// |  User        JobID           JobIDRaw
// |  ec-larstha  1470478         1470478
// |              1470478.batch   1470478.batch
// |              1470478.extern  1470478.extern
// |              1470478.0       1470478.0
// |              1470478.1       1470478.1
// |              1470478.2       1470478.2
// ```
//
// which is consistent with the previous cases, the step ID follows the . of the JobID or JobIDRaw.
//
// ## The meaning of a Job ID
//
// The job ID is complicated.
//
// We will assume that on a cluster where at least some jobs are controlled by Slurm there is a
// single Slurm instance that maintains an increasing job ID for all Slurm jobs and that job IDs
// are never recycled (I've heard from admins that things break if one does that, though see
// below).  Hence when a job is a Slurm job its job ID identifies any event stream belonging to the
// job, no matter when it was collected or what node it ran on, as belonging, and allows those
// streams to be merged into a coherent job view.  To do this, all we need to note in the job
// record is that it came from a Slurm job.
//
// However, there are non-Slurm jobs (even on Slurm clusters, due to the existence of non-Slurm
// nodes and due to other activity worthy of tracking even on Slurm nodes).  The job IDs for these
// jobs are collected from their process group IDs, per Posix, and the monitoring component will
// collect the data for the processes that belong to the same job on a given node into the same Job
// record.  On that node only, the data records for the same job make up the job's event stream.
// There are no inter-node jobs of this kind.  However, process group IDs may conflict with Slurm
// IDs and it is important to ensure that the records are not confused with each other.
//
// To make this more complicated still, non-Slurm IDs can be reused within a single node.  The
// reuse can happen over the long term, when the OS process IDs (and hence the process group IDs)
// wrap around, or over the short term, when a machine is rebooted, runs a job, then is rebooted
// again, runs another job, and so on (may be a typical pattern for a VM or container, or unstable
// nodes).
//
// The monitoring data expose job, epoch, node, and time.  The epoch is a representation of the
// node's boot time.  These fields work together as follows (for non-Slurm jobs).  Consider two
// records A and B. If A.job != B.job or A.node != B.node or A.epoch != B.epoch then they belong to
// different jobs.  Otherwise, we collect all records in which those three fields are the same and
// sort them by time.  If B follows A in the timeline and B.time - A.time > t then A and B are in
// different jobs (one ends with A and the next starts with B).
//
// A suitable value for t is probably on the order of a few hours, TBD.  Linux has a process ID
// space typically around 4e6. Some systems running very many jobs (though not usually HPC systems)
// can wrap around pids in a matter of days.  We want t to be shorter than the shortest plausible
// wraparound time.
