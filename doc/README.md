# Sonar documentation

Start by reading [the user manual](MANUAL.md), which explains most things about what it can do
and how you make it do it.

For a deeper dive into how it works, try [the design document](DESIGN.md).  There are also some
[historical design notes](HISTORICAL.md).

To build it, or to modify it, try [the developer document](HOWTO-DEVELOP.md).

A sample deployment of Sonar on a cluster and a data aggregator on a backend is outlined in
[HOWTO-DEPLOY.md](HOWTO-DEPLOY.md).

For post-processors, the [NEW-FORMAT.md](NEW-FORMAT.md) document defines the data being produced.

The [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) tracks major changes in the various versions.

More obscure configuration and operation instructions may be found in
[HOWTO-DAEMON.md](HOWTO-DAEMON.md) and [HOWTO-KAFKA.md](HOWTO-KAFKA.md).
