# Somebody forgot to properly tag kafka-rust aka kafka v0.10.0 in git.  The rev we're working from
# appears to be 779981238d05364abf180dc4d06e60e107e8a0d9 or possibly
# 32d9d6b7b8c7d8163b37063cdca7568c0fbe18ca - the former is just the merge commit, the latter is
# marked "Version 0.10.0" in the commit message.
# Currently this is without "security", so we don't need openssl
# `cargo add kafka --no-default-features -F snappy,gzip --optional`
